Angie went from being a scared defensive dog who knew life as a dog in a shelter. Then by chance, one look of a picture on the internet, her life changed. I will never forget the first time we met Lynn at our home to start the process of making life better for all of us; Lynn was the dog whisperer this family needed. By fortunate circumstances our next rescue, Winston, was placed in the loving hands of Lynn (through PAWS New England) and somehow she knew he would be a good fit to expand our family.</p><p>There just aren&#39;t enough words to begin to express our deepest gratitude for what Lynn has done for us and our beloved pets (including Rocky our cat!).</p><p>The love Lynn has given our pets is from her heart, and her acts of kindness and compassion are intrinsic which many of us inspire. Lynn will always be our TOP DOG!</p><ul><li>Karen and Kelly W.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-jen-and-chad-goytowski"><h2>Brantley</h2><h3>Intemperate, disobedient</h3><p>We rescued Brantley when he was 10 months old. He was a large lab with absolutely no manners! He was very mouthy, jumped on guests, chased anything from rabbits to cars, pulled on his leash and did not know how to greet other dogs. We tried a lot of different techniques on our own to try to teach him some manners, however, we weren&#39;t very successful.</p><p>We called Lynn and she was able to meet with us within a week. From our first meeting, I could tell she was a great fit for Brantley because she didn&#39;t take any of his nonsense. Lynn&#39;s &quot;Nothing in Life For Free&quot; program was an eye-opener for us as well as for Brantley. After implementing the program for a few weeks, Brantley became more settled and started to relax and listen to our commands.</p><p>We also knew we wanted to train Brantley with an e-collar so we could trust him off-leash and to give him more freedom. Lynn took us through four weeks of e-collar training and now Brantley can be trusted completely off-leash. She even accompanied us to the dog park to make sure Brantley was playing nicely with the other dogs and gave us suggestions for corrections when they were needed.</p><p>At the end of our training, Brantley is a completely different dog. He&#39;s completely settled, heels on leash, no long jumps on guests and now greets and plays with other dogs properly! Friends and family are amazing at what a good day he has turned into. Strangers have even come up to us commenting on what a good dog he is and they wish their dog was that well behaved.</p><p>Lynn worked wonders with Brantley and we are so thankful for all of her endless knowledge she shared with us!</p><ul><li>Jen and Chad Goytowski</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-sue-m"><img src="/images/testimonials/sue-m.jpg" alt="Sue M."><h2>Chelsea</h2><h3>Puppy training, in-home rehab services</h3><p>I have a yellow lab named Chelsea that I enrolled in Lynn&#39;s (doggie) camp at the age of 10 weeks. Since that time, Chelsea has attended day camp two days a week for play, socialization, and training. Also during this time I have boarded Chelsea there while traveling, had her groomed, and had in-house assistance while she recovered from surgery. In short, I have used all the services offered by Wunderdog. In my years of having dogs and going to other facilities, I can honestly say this is the VERY BEST I HAVE SEEN. Lynn and her team are totally dedicated to the care and health of the dogs at camp, and her skill and experience leads to a very happy, safe, and caring environment for them. Chelsea eagerly jumps out of the car to get with her friends each time I bring her to camp!</p><ul><li>Sue M.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-david-stafford"><img src="/images/testimonials/david-stratford.png" alt="David Stafford"><h2>Jackson</h2><h3>Anxiety, territorial aggression</h3><p>I’m going to start at the end: For having Lynn Wunderli’s guidance, Jackson enjoys life better and I enjoy Jackson better.</p><p>About a year ago, there was a significant change at my household and I wanted help ensuring that Jackson transitioned well. Calling Lynn in was the best decision I could have made.</p><p>Lynn observed that there was a void in leadership in the household that was adversely affecting Jackson’s confidence, happiness, and well-being. We all know that it’s OUR end of the leash that needs the help, in most cases. That was the situation in my household.</p><p>Lynn did an in-home assessment of me and Jackson, on a Thursday. She gave me guidance and instruction in a supportive, but no-nonsense way. I followed her advice as closely as humanly possible.</p><p>This may sound like an exaggeration, but I tell this story the same way to everyone that will listen: That Sunday (yes, three days later) it dawned on me that the nervous, pacing, needy dog that Lynn had met was serenely going through his day with none of the previous behaviors that had concerned me.</p><p>With her guidance, and “Nothing in Life for Free” at the core, Jackson had begun a wonderful transformation. He may never be a perfectly confident and serene boy (who knows what he went through in his first six months before I rescued him) but Lynn’s principles, applied diligently, will ensure that he’s “the best he can be”.</p><p>Since I met Lynn, she has been there for me every….EVERY….time I’ve needed help or advice.</p><p>I’ve now added another member to my pack and between them, my pups have attended four of Lynn’s classes at Camp K-9.</p><p>Thank you, Lynn, for everything.</p><ul><li>David Stafford</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-sara-petzold"><h2>Milo</h2><h3>Agressiveness</h3><p>I got Lynn Wunderli’s business card from Camp K-9 while I was musing to staff about how to endure the coming teen months of my Giant Schnauzer Milo. Milo is a very sweet dog, and I have had Giant Schnauzers before so I am familiar with their energy level, but I have always gotten them at an older age, and there has always been another dog in the house to help with the training. Not the case with Milo.</p><p>When I saw a Giant Schnauzer on Lynn’s business card, I figured she would be able to help me if the need arose. I first met with Lynn in June when Milo was 10 months old. I had become concerned because of Milos high energy level combined with inappropriate barking and growling when he saw something unfamiliar to him. I was particularly concerned that he was growling at the young kids across the street if he saw them outside.</p><p>Lynn took immediate control of Milo. Not in a bad way, but in a “Dog Whisperer” sort of way. She was relaxed with him and that relaxed him as well. She got to know both of us and pointed out his domineering ways and the ways I was not helping the situation. She put a leash on Milo and walked him around at heel, made him do what she wanted, and all in a lowkey way. It was truly amazing!</p><p>I knew that if Milo was a normal dog, and not a vicious killer-type, any problems he was having were really the fault of my training and not anything inherent in him. Lynn immediately assessed Milo as a normal Giant Schnauzer which was very reassuring to me. She worked with us both, encouraging me in what I did right, and interpreting Milo’s behavior in light of what I was projecting.</p><p>I met with Lynn several times, and plan to do so again. She set up an easy to understand protocol to address a number of issues, provided written information about what we were trying to accomplish, and followed up on our progress without being judgmental of my shortcomings as a dog owner.</p><p>I unhesitatingly recommend Lynn to anyone who would like to get some assistance in working with their dog. She is kind and compassionate to both dog and owner and trains both with clear instruction and follow-through. Although Milo is a large dog at over 90 lbs, I believe she would be able to work with any size dog without problem.   Milo is still a bit of a project; he is now 14 months old and still an adolescent, but he is improving. I no longer have to worry about walking him past strangers or children. Yesterday, I walked him past a group of high schoolers throwing a football on the sidewalk by a bus stop. I was able to walk him past them on the same side of the street and maneuvering around them rather than trying to avoid the situation. Milo has improved immensely with the lessons he has learned from Lynn. Quite frankly, I was thinking of finding a home for him when I first met Lynn, because I despaired that he would ever be the well-behaved dog I wanted him to be. Now, I think I’ll keep him…</p><ul><li>Sara Petzold</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-mary-and-rusty-r"><img src="/images/testimonials/mary-and-rusty-r.jpg" alt="Mary and Rusty R."><h2>Nash</h2><h3>Puppy training, adolescent-to-adult training</h3><p>We&#39;ve had the opportunity to see first-hand Lynn&#39;s excellent training with Nash, our 6-year old lab mix, and most recently our 15-month shepard mix, Tex. Lynn exceeded our expectations. Lynn has been a terrific coach and resource for us as a family.</p><ul><li>Mary and Rusty R.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-gina-and-bruce-a"><img src="/images/testimonials/gina-and-bruce-a.jpg" alt="Gina and Bruce A."><h2>Petey</h2><h3>Physical &amp; mental rehabilitation, re-home</h3><p>It is with great and whole-hearted confidence that I recommend Lynn Wunderli and her dog training and dog care services. Over the last 8 years, Lynn has provided tremendous leadership, compassion and skill both in taking care of our 3 dogs over this extended period of time as well as helping us become much better canine parents. Lynn is highly passionate about the care and well-being of all dogs she has the opportunity to work with, as is testament by how excited dogs are to be in her magnetic presence. She is also dedicated to continually learning all she can about canine care, health and behavior issues. She is a tremendous resource not only for her excellent services but also for her advice and insights as well. Over the years we have trained with Lynn, entrusted her with daycare, boarding and grooming services, as well as followed her advice with regards to a number of more complex issues such as breeding, adopting rescue dogs as well as understanding canine behavior issues. We believe all individuals and dogs who work with her will so greatly benefit from her work.</p><ul><li>Gina and Bruce A.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-diane-and-jack"><img src="/images/testimonials/diane-and-jack-h.jpg" alt="Diane and Jack"><h2>Sassy</h2><h3>Fear, aggression, lack of leadership</h3><p>We have a 17 month old Saint Bernard. She had a VERY bad experience with a vet at 5 months of age. It had gotten to the point where she would not let anyone touch her ears or her nails--she would snap at us is we tried either of these with her. We went to a new vet who suggested we give Lynn a call. We did, and it was the right decision.</p><p>Lynn came to our house and evaluated our girl. From Lynn&#39;s evaluation we learned that she was only defending herself after being traumatized, and thought we were gong to hurt her. Lynn started the training process with us, and taught us how to work with her without scaring her and becoming her pack leaders so that she could trust us more. Lynn suggested her day camp for safe socialization and so that she could continue working on her desensitization of her ears, nails, and trust issues. During this time, we had our follow up consultations and continued our work at home.</p><p>In a couple of months the snapping stopped. The dogs trust Lynn and she has unlimited patience with them; Lynn understands dog behavior and can put her finger on why they do things and how to stop negative or dangerous behaviors.</p><p>Our girl is a whole different dog now. We can clean her ears ourselves, she no longer gets ear infections, and we can take her to vets without a problem. The vet staff says she is a different dog! They can examine her and give her shots without sedating her anymore.</p><p>Wunderdog is always SPOTLESS! The dogs go for long walks, and get plenty of play time and rest periods. Lynn always keeps both eyes on all the dogs, and communicates everything with us to make sure that we can address any issues before they become problems.</p><p>When I decided to add another dog to our home recently, Lynn suggested we rescue. She has worked with many rescue dogs, and we trust her judgment. She helped us select one from PAWS New England. She generously brought our selection home to her house to foster and evaluate her. It was good because my husband, our St. Bernard, and myself could meet her and spend time with her and make sure she was a good fit for our family. I worked out great. Lynn was a tremendous help with the whole thing.</p><p>I would recommend Lynn to anyone. I don&#39;t know where we would be if she hadn&#39;t come into our lives.</p><ul><li>Diane and Jack</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-joanne-and-paul"><p>We&#39;ve had many wunderful experiences with Wunderdog. We have been on several vacations in the past few years and wouldn&#39;t think of leaving our babies with anyone else. It is such a great atmosphere and both Maggie and Rosie are right at home. I would recommend Wunderdog to anyone, and I have. All of our friends also use Wunderdog and have been very happy. Thanks Lynn for making a great place for our babies!</p><ul><li>JoAnne &amp; Paul</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-ann-b"><img src="/images/testimonials/ann-b.jpg" alt="Ann B."><p>I&#39;ve known Lynn (and her whole family) long before I got my Rosie, (a neurotic, Polish Lowland Sheepdog that I adopted at age 2 1/2 years). Rosie came with issues, for which Lynn has been a fabulous resource and source of great advice. In addition, Rosie looks fabulous after every grooming. Her hair is a constant challenge and Lynn has risen to the challenge. My dog looks great every time! Rosie is not a dog that can be left anywhere, but Lynn loves her, she is well treated and has adapted well to being part of the Wunderdog family.</p><ul><li>Ann B.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-jim-and-joanne"><img src="/images/testimonials/jim-and-joanne.jpg" alt="Jim and Joanne"><p>We have a dog which had severe socialization issues and separation anxiety. Lynn worked with us to deal with our dogs issues and we started sending our dog to Lynn&#39;s daycare. The results of Lynn&#39;s personalized training and daycare were amazing.

Lynn has a day care that is more than just a place for our dog to go. She teaches obedience and socialization skills as part of her day care process and has found a way to get each dog to not only get along with other dogs, but to also &quot;be friends.&quot; It is truly hard to describe, but imagine your dog arriving at day care and being welcomed by the other dogs as if they were all family.</p><p>Lynn believes in the health and well-being of each dog she has in her care and has them exercising as part of their day -- this can be anywhere from a hike to a swim. She ensures they rest and have fun, and watches over them as if they were all her own. When it comes to our boy, Larry, she has helped us with his uniqueness and has given us simple and successful tools/tips to train him and care for him. He is remarkable dog and we feel, in part, Lynn has helped that happen.</p><p>Whether we board Larry while on vacation, train him with Lynn, have him spend a day at day camp, or get him groomed, Lynn handles all and we have come to trust her and Larry has come to love her. She has helped many people we know and no one would argue that she is an amazing care giver and dog trainer. She runs a well-oiled operation and has a system second-to-none from the time you drop off your pet to the time you pick up!</p><p>Wunderdog is always clean and the yard is designed for fun and safety. Lynn LISTENS to you as as an owner, and communicates with you whenever your pet is in her care.</p><p>Lynn has a gift and shares it willingly and happily. Whoever works with Lynn will find what we have -- an uncommon and unmatched level of professionalism, care, and knowledge that will not only win clients over, but build a relationship that will be long lasting and rewarding.</p><ul><li>Carmen and Victoria</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-ellie-s"><p>I would like to write a very deserving testimonial for the Wunderful Wunderdog experience.

Lynn&#39;s expertise in animal behavior, training and grooming, has been instrumental in raising my dogs. I have relied on her for all behavioral issues (excessive barking, house training etc...). She is also a trustworthy, honest, and loving care taker of my dogs when I leave them for doggy day care or overnight boarding. I highly recommend Lynn for her dog training and grooming expertise, and/or her knowledge of caring for animals while they are away from home.</p><ul><li>Kathleen S.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-kathy-and-jon-r"><img src="/images/testimonials/kathy-and-jon-r.jpg" alt="Kathy and Jon R."><p>My name is Kathy Richard. My husband and I own two wonderful dogs. A Boxer, Rocky, and a German Shepherd, Dakota. We recently moved from a home with lots of space to a smaller home which does not provide adequate outdoor space. I was looking for a place to bring my dogs on a weekly basis where they could go have fun, exercise, and be socialized with other dogs. An employee of mine suggested bringing them to see Lynn at Wunderdog in NH.</p><p>My husband and I felt very welcome instantly, and as we were interviewing each other, Lynn was observing both of our dogs. When we had all of our questions answered, Lynn was able to describe our dog&#39;s personalities PERFECTLY!</p><p>Dakota has had a hard time socializing with other dogs...but Lynn worked one-on-one with him, and the transformation we have seen in Dakota has been amazing! We can now bring BOTH our dogs to a local dog park without fear o altercations with other dogs. We will be forever grateful to Lynn for this.</p><p>Wunderdog Day Camp offers so many different aspects of dog training as well as daily manners class, agility, socialization, 2.5 - 4 mile walks each day, pools in the summer, scheduled nap time, grooming, and most importantly to me, an individual plan for each of my dogs according to their needs.</p><p>I can&#39;t imagine a better place for my dogs!</p><ul><li>Kathy and Jon R.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-linda-d"><p>I am the proud owner of a Bichon named Lucky who isn&#39;t so Lucky. We purchased him from a breeder a few years ago and at age one he was diagnosed with a dog form of Lupus. This means that his immune system is very low and he has extremely sensitive skin. The poor guy has patches all over him where hair will never grow back. This is leading up to the wonderful care Lynn gives to my pet. I have been bringing Lucky to Lynn for puppy play time, grooming and pet sitting when needed since he was a pup. I was so happy that I found such a qualified, caring and loving person I can rely on. I couldn&#39;t bear leaving him with just any pet store groomer or vet.I know Lucky gets special individual attention when he is with Lynn and her family.The girls absolutely adore Lucky and he is absolutely spoiled when he comes home. He is off and running with the pack the minute he hits the door and never looks back.

She is one year now and I am so happy with the progress that she has made. Lynn and her staff have been so helpful with all aspects of Kyra&#39;s care. Lynn came to our house when we first got Kyra and spoke with our entire family, helping us to understand our new puppy&#39;s needs and behavior. She helped with potty training, crate training and obedience training. She also stressed to us the importance of socialization with other dogs, and Kyra absolutely loves going to &quot;puppy school&quot; one day a week to play with all her Wunderdog friends. I really think that if we had not been referred to Lynn, we would not have made it through this first year. We have also boarded Kyra several times and it has been a good experience for all of us. I know that Kyra would highly recommend Wunderdog to any and all of her canine friends and we totally agree!.</p><ul><li>Lori S.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-marge-l"><img src="/images/testimonials/marge-l.jpg" alt="Marge L."><p>My dogs have been cared for and loved by our friend Lynn Wunderli. We have boarded our dogs with Lynn for over six years. When we first began, one of our dogs was older, blind and somewhat nervous as to where she was. Lynn and her family took such great care of our little Tucket. From feeding her by hand to giving her scents to find her own way in and out of the house put our mind at ease. She became so comfortable that even at her elder stage in life would get excited to go back.</p><p>Once our Tucket passed along came another puppy. Lynn never hesitated taking our two dogs Lily and Lucie together. Lynn provided our dogs play time, walk time and quiet time with a report of their activity everyday. Her play area had many toys and a large area, which was perfect for my playful Lucie. The long walks gave our Lily her favorite exploration time.</p><p>Lynn has not only provided boarding services, but she has also given me me training lessons for my somewhat delinquent labs. Lynn is so knowledgeable, and truly understands the way to train my dogs was to actually train me! Lynn is a very patient teacher. She has given me great insight as to the dogs’ body language and why they act the way they do!</p><p>I would highly recommend Lynn Wunderli for dog training and boarding. Lynn is passionate and enjoys every aspect of her business. The true testament is the happiness of the dogs after spending time with Lynn.</p><ul><li>Marge L.</li></ul></article><article id="testimonial-emily-a"><p>Lynn Wunderli has not only been a very good friend to me over the years, but has been a terrific surrogate mother to my dogs.

We have been working closely with Lynn over the last year and have created a wonderful relationship. Her knowledge, training skills, and one-on-one consults have been an asset to our patients and our hospital. We are a multi-doctor practice that sees a large number of clients with pets in need of direction, training and behavior modification plans. Our referrals to Lynn have been very successful and we have seen a dramatic improvement in these pets following a behavior modification plan created by Wunderdog.</p><p>Lynn has excellent communication skills, is extremely organized, and very reliable. The client feedback from her is outstanding and the pet&#39;s behavior is proof of her dedication and hard work. Along with her client interactions, she also was willing to share her knowledge with our hospital staff. She created a professional power point presentation (&quot;Canine Behavior in The Vet Hospital Setting&quot;) that was full of pertinent information, left us with client information handouts, and numerous tips to share with our clients.</p><p>It is very important to us to be able to refer our clients to someone we trust and who will be able to tailor the behavior plan for both the client and their pet. Lynn is an asset to our practice in all regards and has always treated each pet as an individual.

Thank goodness for Lynn! She helped him with basic commands and gave us the instructions we needed too! She gave us amazing tips that were tailored just for our dog and his unending energy.
