This (up to 2 hours) session is terrific for those clients with new puppies, or those with any new addition to their family wishing to start off with all the advantages!

Includes one follow up phone call or one email at no extra charge (phone is limited to 15 minutes) and ALL FAMILY MEMBERS ARE WELCOME!

This (up to 2 hours) session is for clients who are concerned with their dog's behavior(s). These clients have either been dealing with issues without resolution, or are seeing new issues--all of which are affecting their life with their dog. These issues can range from mild to severe, from obnoxious to aggressive behavior...

## Separation anxiety initial consultation

Up to 2 hours:  $250 flat fee (after 2 hours, HOURLY RATE WILL APPLY).
*Diagnosis/Prognosis to be discussed at the end of the session, and successive sessions to be outlined at that time.

Separation Anxiety (SA) is a complicated condition that cannot be modified with an "easy fix."  Therefore, diagnosis-then-prognosis/protocol/program is time-consuming and laborious for both Trainer and Owner(s). Owners/Clients MUST BE PREPARED TO COMMIT TO A MINIMUM OF 6 WEEKS, with a minimum of 1 hour per week of session training. Phone calls and emails are routinely excerised on average at least 2 to 3 times per week (at hourly rate).
WE CAN HELP FIX THE "UNFIXABLE," but only with an owner's commitment and time/energy/financial expenditures associated with treatment.

- Hourly rate: $95/HOUR (with Lynn Wunderli)
- Telephone/email/Skype rate: $45/HOUR

PACKAGES: After completing the Initial Consultation of "Great Beginnings/The Basics & Fine Tuning," clients can ADD follow up packages to help save time and money!

## Follow-up bundles
- 3 One-Hour Sessions = $240 (Save $45!)

All Follow Up Bundles must be used within 3 months of purchase. Wunderdog is not responsible for canceled appointments (unless emergency or illness by either party), and all packages are prepaid, non-transferable, and non-refundable.

Bundle fees may be applied towards Skype, phone, and email sessions!

Bundles are not applicable for Behavioral Modification or Separation Anxiety consultations. These specialized programs require the initial consultation fees, then the hourly rate thereafter.

*Nature vs Nurture* ($125) 6 week class (meets once per week):
This class is for owners who want to learn more about their dog's behaviors (and what to do about unwanted behaviors), and who also want to expose their dog to unfamiliar dogs and humans in a safe, controlled, fun, and healthy environment.
Come spend an hour weekly with us!  You will learn more than you ever thought possible!

- *Time Requisite* The class will last approximately 1 hour in length (although first class will be longer for acclimation and assessments

### Class Requirements

- Each dog needs to be under the owner's control at all times. Appropriate training equipment* specific to each individual dog's needs must be used at all times on any property where class will take place. (*Exception:  NO CHOKE COLLARS.)
- Each dog MUST be up-to-date on all vaccinations, INCLUDING BORDETELLA (Canine Cough).
- Each owner will be responsible for bringing paper and pen for taking notes.*   (*Paper and pen will also be available for purchase at the first class if needed)
- If owner is unsure of dog's ability to remain under control, and suspects their dog to be disruptive past the 'settling-in period' of each class, an appointment can be made for a behavioral assessment prior to class (before class commencement or afterwards).

If assessment requires more than 15 minutes of Trainer's time (and there are no immediate solutions), an appointment can be made for a full behavioral evaluation, scheduled at the owner's convenience. (Wunderdog's training fees will then apply. Reassessment for class participation will be determined after behavioral evaluation.)

- Class fees will be refunded or transferred towards another class if participant cancels within 5 days prior to onset of first class.
- Class fees are non-refundable once class has commenced (regardless of reason for dropping).
