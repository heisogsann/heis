I have a yellow lab named Chelsea that I enrolled in Lynn's (doggie) camp at the age of 10 weeks. Since that time, Chelsea has attended day camp two days a week for play, socialization, and training. Also during this time I have boarded Chelsea there while traveling, had her groomed, and had in-house assistance while she recovered from surgery. In short, I have used all the services offered by Wunderdog. In my years of having dogs and going to other facilities, I can honestly say this is the VERY BEST I HAVE SEEN. Lynn and her team are totally dedicated to the care and health of the dogs at camp, and her skill and experience leads to a very happy, safe, and caring environment for them. Chelsea eagerly jumps out of the car to get with her friends each time I bring her to camp!
