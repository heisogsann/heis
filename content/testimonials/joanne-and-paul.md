We've had many wunderful experiences with Wunderdog. We have been on several vacations in the past few years and wouldn't think of leaving our babies with anyone else. It is such a great atmosphere and both Maggie and Rosie are right at home. I would recommend Wunderdog to anyone, and I have. All of our friends also use Wunderdog and have been very happy. Thanks Lynn for making a great place for our babies!
