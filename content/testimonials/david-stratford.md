I’m going to start at the end:  For having Lynn Wunderli’s guidance, Jackson enjoys life better and I enjoy Jackson better.

About a year ago, there was a significant change at my household and I wanted help ensuring that Jackson transitioned well.  Calling Lynn in was the best decision I could have made.

Lynn observed that there was a void in leadership in the household that was adversely affecting Jackson’s confidence, happiness, and well-being.  We all know that it’s OUR end of the leash that needs the help, in most cases.  That was the situation in my household.

Lynn did an in-home assessment of me and Jackson, on a Thursday.  She gave me guidance and instruction in a supportive, but no-nonsense way.  I followed her advice as closely as humanly possible.

This may sound like an exaggeration, but I tell this story the same way to everyone that will listen:  That Sunday (yes, three days later) it dawned on me that the nervous, pacing, needy dog that Lynn had met was serenely going through his day with none of the previous behaviors that had concerned me.

With her guidance, and “Nothing in Life for Free” at the core, Jackson had begun a wonderful transformation.  He may never be a perfectly confident and serene boy (who knows what he went through in his first six months before I rescued him) but Lynn’s principles, applied diligently, will ensure that he’s “the best he can be”.

Since I met Lynn, she has been there for me every….EVERY….time I’ve needed help or advice.

I’ve now added another member to my pack and between them, my pups have attended four of Lynn’s classes at Camp K-9.

Thank you, Lynn, for everything.
