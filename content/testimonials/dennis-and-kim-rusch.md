My wife and I had never been dog owners before we found Nadia, a Siberian Husky, who we love very much. So as you can imagine we wanted to have a safe setting to take Nadia during the day while we worked. But it is so much more than that. At Wunderdog we met Lynn and her family and have made a lasting friendship and a second home for Nadia.

From Nadia's point of view this experience is one that she looks forward to as often as possible. Wunderdog offers us a worry-free, playful atmosphere and great socialization for our dog. In addition, we can receive personal training to develop Nadia's obedience skills, or have her groomed while she is at daycare.

Wunderdog is more than just daycare... it is care from people who have a true passion for improving the quality of life for our family pet. We are so pleased with how our dog is treated and how well she responds to attending daycare and the benefits of having a more social, well mannered dog; we can't imagine not taking Nadia to see her friends at daycare.

My wife and I want to extend a heartfelt thank you for giving us peace-of-mind knowing our dog is safe and well cared for while she is in Wunderdog's care.

Thank you.
