My dogs have been cared for and loved by our friend Lynn Wunderli. We have boarded our dogs with Lynn for over six years. When we first began, one of our dogs was older, blind and somewhat nervous as to where she was. Lynn and her family took such great care of our little Tucket. From feeding her by hand to giving her scents to find her own way in and out of the house put our mind at ease. She became so comfortable that even at her elder stage in life would get excited to go back.

Once our Tucket passed along came another puppy. Lynn never hesitated taking our two dogs Lily and Lucie together. Lynn provided our dogs play time, walk time and quiet time with a report of their activity everyday. Her play area had many toys and a large area, which was perfect for my playful Lucie. The long walks gave our Lily her favorite exploration time.

Lynn has not only provided boarding services, but she has also given me me training lessons for my somewhat delinquent labs. Lynn is so knowledgeable, and truly understands the way to train my dogs was to actually train me! Lynn is a very patient teacher. She has given me great insight as to the dogs’ body language and why they act the way they do!

I would highly recommend Lynn Wunderli for dog training and boarding. Lynn is passionate and enjoys every aspect of her business. The true testament is the happiness of the dogs after spending time with Lynn.
