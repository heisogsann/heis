Thanks to Lynn, (our rescue dog) Angie's life has been fulfilling and all that a dog could want. Angie went from being a scared defensive dog who knew life as a dog in a shelter. Then by chance, one look of a picture on the internet, her life changed. I will never forget the first time we met Lynn at our home to start the process of making life better for all of us; Lynn was the dog whisperer this family needed. By fortunate circumstances our next rescue, Winston, was placed in the loving hands of Lynn (through PAWS New England) and somehow she knew he would be a good fit to expand our family.

There just aren't enough words to begin to express our deepest gratitude for what Lynn has done for us and our beloved pets (including Rocky our cat!).

The love Lynn has given our pets is from her heart, and her acts of kindness and compassion are intrinsic which many of us inspire. Lynn will always be our TOP DOG!
