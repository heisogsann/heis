We are delighted to be able to recommend Wunderdog of Sandown, NH, and in particular, Lynn Wunderli. Lynn came into our home to help us train our dog Albie. He was a very spirited one-year old Golden Retriever at the time, a rescue dog full of mischief with no manners at all! Thank goodness for Lynn! She helped him with basic commands and gave us the instructions we needed too! She gave us amazing tips that were tailored just for our dog and his unending energy. It has also been a pleasure to send Albie to daycare at Wunderdog once a week where he was able to play with other dogs and have some additional training. Lynn really has a way with dogs!
