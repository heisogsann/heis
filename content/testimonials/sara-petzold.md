I got Lynn Wunderli’s business card from Camp K-9 while I was musing to staff about how to
endure the coming teen months of my Giant Schnauzer Milo. Milo is a very sweet dog, and I
have had Giant Schnauzers before so I am familiar with their energy level, but I have always
gotten them at an older age, and there has always been another dog in the house to help with
the training. Not the case with Milo.

When I saw a Giant Schnauzer on Lynn’s business card, I figured she would be able to help me
if the need arose. I first met with Lynn in June when Milo was 10 months old. I had become
concerned because of Milos high energy level combined with inappropriate barking and
growling when he saw something unfamiliar to him. I was particularly concerned that he was
growling at the young kids across the street if he saw them outside.

Lynn took immediate control of Milo. Not in a bad way, but in a “Dog Whisperer” sort of way.
She was relaxed with him and that relaxed him as well. She got to know both of us and
pointed out his domineering ways and the ways I was not helping the situation. She put a
leash on Milo and walked him around at heel, made him do what she wanted, and all in a lowkey
way. It was truly amazing!

I knew that if Milo was a normal dog, and not a vicious killer-type, any problems he was
having were really the fault of my training and not anything inherent in him. Lynn
immediately assessed Milo as a normal Giant Schnauzer which was very reassuring to me. She
worked with us both, encouraging me in what I did right, and interpreting Milo’s behavior in
light of what I was projecting.

I met with Lynn several times, and plan to do so again. She set up an easy to understand
protocol to address a number of issues, provided written information about what we were
trying to accomplish, and followed up on our progress without being judgmental of my
shortcomings as a dog owner.

I unhesitatingly recommend Lynn to anyone who would like to get some assistance in working
with their dog. She is kind and compassionate to both dog and owner and trains both with
clear instruction and follow-through. Although Milo is a large dog at over 90 lbs, I believe she
would be able to work with any size dog without problem.
 
Milo is still a bit of a project; he is now 14 months old and still an adolescent, but he is
improving. I no longer have to worry about walking him past strangers or children. Yesterday, I
walked him past a group of high schoolers throwing a football on the sidewalk by a bus stop. I
was able to walk him past them on the same side of the street and maneuvering around them
rather than trying to avoid the situation. Milo has improved immensely with the lessons he has
learned from Lynn. Quite frankly, I was thinking of finding a home for him when I first met
Lynn, because I despaired that he would ever be the well-behaved dog I wanted him to be.
Now, I think I’ll keep him…
