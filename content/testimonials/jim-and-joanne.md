We have a dog which had severe socialization issues and separation anxiety. Lynn worked with us to deal with our dogs issues and we started sending our dog to Lynn's daycare. The results of Lynn's personalized training and daycare were amazing. She made all the difference in the world in our having a happy and social dog.
