It is with great and whole-hearted confidence that I recommend Lynn Wunderli and her dog training and dog care services. Over the last 8 years, Lynn has provided tremendous leadership, compassion and skill both in taking care of our 3 dogs over this extended period of time as well as helping us become much better canine parents. Lynn is highly passionate about the care and well-being of all dogs she has the opportunity to work with, as is testament by how excited dogs are to be in her magnetic presence. She is also dedicated to continually learning all she can about canine care, health and behavior issues. She is a tremendous resource not only for her excellent services but also for her advice and insights as well. Over the years we have trained with Lynn, entrusted her with daycare, boarding and grooming services, as well as followed her advice with regards to a number of more complex issues such as breeding, adopting rescue dogs as well as understanding canine behavior issues. We believe all individuals and dogs who work with her will so greatly benefit from her work.ï»¿
