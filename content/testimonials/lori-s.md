I have been taking my German Shepard puppy to Wunderdog since she was about 3 months old. She is one year now and I am so happy with the progress that she has made. Lynn and her staff have been so helpful with all aspects of Kyra's care. Lynn came to our house when we first got Kyra and spoke with our entire family, helping us to understand our new puppy's needs and behavior. She helped with potty training, crate training and obedience training. She also stressed to us the importance of socialization with other dogs, and Kyra absolutely loves going to "puppy school" one day a week to play with all her Wunderdog friends. I really think that if we had not been referred to Lynn, we would not have made it through this first year. We have also boarded Kyra several times and it has been a good experience for all of us. I know that Kyra would highly recommend Wunderdog to any and all of her canine friends and we totally agree!.
