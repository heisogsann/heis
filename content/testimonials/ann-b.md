I've known Lynn (and her whole family) long before I got my Rosie, (a neurotic, Polish Lowland Sheepdog that I adopted at age 2 1/2 years). Rosie came with issues, for which Lynn has been a fabulous resource and source of great advice. In addition, Rosie looks fabulous after every grooming. Her hair is a constant challenge and Lynn has risen to the challenge. My dog looks great every time! Rosie is not a dog that can be left anywhere, but Lynn loves her, she is well treated and has adapted well to being part of the Wunderdog family.﻿
