My name is Kathy Richard. My husband and I own two wonderful dogs. A Boxer, Rocky, and a German Shepherd, Dakota. We recently moved from a home with lots of space to a smaller home which does not provide adequate outdoor space. I was looking for a place to bring my dogs on a weekly basis where they could go have fun, exercise, and be socialized with other dogs. An employee of mine suggested bringing them to see Lynn at Wunderdog in NH.

My husband and I felt very welcome instantly, and as we were interviewing each other, Lynn was observing both of our dogs. When we had all of our questions answered, Lynn was able to describe our dog's personalities PERFECTLY!

Dakota has had a hard time socializing with other dogs...but Lynn worked one-on-one with him, and the transformation we have seen in Dakota has been amazing! We can now bring BOTH our dogs to a local dog park without fear o altercations with other dogs. We will be forever grateful to Lynn for this.

Wunderdog Day Camp offers so many different aspects of dog training as well as daily manners class, agility, socialization, 2.5 - 4 mile walks each day, pools in the summer, scheduled nap time, grooming, and most importantly to me, an individual plan for each of my dogs according to their needs.

I can't imagine a better place for my dogs!
