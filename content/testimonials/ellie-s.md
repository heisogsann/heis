I would like to write a very deserving testimonial for the Wunderful Wunderdog experience. Harry beagle and I love to takes trips to Wunderdog. We love the family atmosphere and warm welcoming feeling when we arrive. The service is absolutely Wunderful and surpassed by none. Lynn and staff are so accommodating and often receive Harry on very short notice. I am so grateful to know all of the Wunderful Wonderdog family. We will love them forever!
