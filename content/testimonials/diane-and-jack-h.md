We have a 17 month old Saint Bernard. She had a VERY bad experience with a vet at 5 months of age. It had gotten to the point where she would not let anyone touch her ears or her nails--she would snap at us is we tried either of these with her. We went to a new vet who suggested we give Lynn a call. We did, and it was the right decision.

Lynn came to our house and evaluated our girl. From Lynn's evaluation we learned that she was only defending herself after being traumatized, and thought we were gong to hurt her. Lynn started the training process with us, and taught us how to work with her without scaring her and becoming her pack leaders so that she could trust us more. Lynn suggested her day camp for safe socialization and so that she could continue working on her desensitization of her ears, nails, and trust issues. During this time, we had our follow up consultations and continued our work at home.

In a couple of months the snapping stopped. The dogs trust Lynn and she has unlimited patience with them; Lynn understands dog behavior and can put her finger on why they do things and how to stop negative or dangerous behaviors.

Our girl is a whole different dog now. We can clean her ears ourselves, she no longer gets ear infections, and we can take her to vets without a problem. The vet staff says she is a different dog! They can examine her and give her shots without sedating her anymore.

Wunderdog is always SPOTLESS! The dogs go for long walks, and get plenty of play time and rest periods. Lynn always keeps both eyes on all the dogs, and communicates everything with us to make sure that we can address any issues before they become problems.

When I decided to add another dog to our home recently, Lynn suggested we rescue. She has worked with many rescue dogs, and we trust her judgment. She helped us select one from PAWS New England. She generously brought our selection home to her house to foster and evaluate her. It was good because my husband, our St. Bernard, and myself could meet her and spend time with her and make sure she was a good fit for our family. I worked out great. Lynn was a tremendous help with the whole thing.

I would recommend Lynn to anyone. I don't know where we would be if she hadn't come into our lives.
