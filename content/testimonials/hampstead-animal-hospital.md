We are writing on behalf of Lynn Wunderli and Wunderdog K-9 Care & Training, LLC. We have been working closely with Lynn over the last year and have created a wonderful relationship. Her knowledge, training skills, and one-on-one consults have been an asset to our patients and our hospital. We are a multi-doctor practice that sees a large number of clients with pets in need of direction, training and behavior modification plans. Our referrals to Lynn have been very successful and we have seen a dramatic improvement in these pets following a behavior modification plan created by Wunderdog.

Lynn has excellent communication skills, is extremely organized, and very reliable. The client feedback from her is outstanding and the pet's behavior is proof of her dedication and hard work. Along with her client interactions, she also was willing to share her knowledge with our hospital staff. She created a professional power point presentation ("Canine Behavior in The Vet Hospital Setting") that was full of pertinent information, left us with client information handouts, and numerous tips to share with our clients.

It is very important to us to be able to refer our clients to someone we trust and who will be able to tailor the behavior plan for both the client and their pet. Lynn is an asset to our practice in all regards and has always treated each pet as an individual. Hampstead Animal Hospital has benefited from a partnership with her because fundamental training is essential to making our patients have a positive experience. Any hospital that is able to work with her is extremely lucky and will be pleased with her results!
