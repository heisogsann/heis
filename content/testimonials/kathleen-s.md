Lynn has been training and caring for my dogs for over 5 years. Lynn's expertise in animal behavior, training and grooming, has been instrumental in raising my dogs. I have relied on her for all behavioral issues (excessive barking, house training etc...). She is also a trustworthy, honest, and loving care taker of my dogs when I leave them for doggy day care or overnight boarding. I highly recommend Lynn for her dog training and grooming expertise, and/or her knowledge of caring for animals while they are away from home.
