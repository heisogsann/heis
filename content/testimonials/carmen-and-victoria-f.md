Lynn Wunderli has cared for our little guy for over 2 years now and she has taught he and us so much about the precious relationship between people and their pets. Lynn has a day care that is more than just a place for our dog to go. She teaches obedience and socialization skills as part of her day care process and has found a way to get each dog to not only get along with other dogs, but to also "be friends." It is truly hard to describe, but imagine your dog arriving at day care and being welcomed by the other dogs as if they were all family.

Lynn believes in the health and well-being of each dog she has in her care and has them exercising as part of their day -- this can be anywhere from a hike to a swim. She ensures they rest and have fun, and watches over them as if they were all her own. When it comes to our boy, Larry, she has helped us with his uniqueness and has given us simple and successful tools/tips to train him and care for him. He is remarkable dog and we feel, in part, Lynn has helped that happen.

Whether we board Larry while on vacation, train him with Lynn, have him spend a day at day camp, or get him groomed, Lynn handles all and we have come to trust her and Larry has come to love her. She has helped many people we know and no one would argue that she is an amazing care giver and dog trainer. She runs a well-oiled operation and has a system second-to-none from the time you drop off your pet to the time you pick up!

Wunderdog is always clean and the yard is designed for fun and safety. Lynn LISTENS to you as as an owner, and communicates with you whenever your pet is in her care.

Lynn has a gift and shares it willingly and happily. Whoever works with Lynn will find what we have -- an uncommon and unmatched level of professionalism, care, and knowledge that will not only win clients over, but build a relationship that will be long lasting and rewarding.
